# Summary

Learn Computer Science with a clear curriculum of curated materials.
I want to make one thing clear: There is no easy way to learn about this stuff, there are quick ways, yes. Not easy ways though.
The quickest way, is to not waste your time with pointless mediocre courses when you could instead pick up a free book and teach yourself.
That's 1 big book, or 3 specialized smaller books. To prove my point, before you consider going on Coursera, search for a popular [programming language 
here](https://www.classcentral.com) and reviews for the courses you're interested in. Reviews imply Coursera > edX, but the curriculum of online schooling is limited, and even the best universities in the world have educational issues, your best bet is to pick your favorite books and learn by practice. MIT content is also outdated. Videos are okay, but attention drifts, while practice lingers. Don't outsource your education or base on old content. Get a proper book written in your language with (preferably) your style and no fluff. Otherwise pay for a good degree program.

**Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Intro CS*: for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them
- *Core CS*: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take
- *Advanced CS*: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests
- *Final Project*: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide

## Prerequisites

- [Core CS](#core-cs) assumes the student has already taken [high school math](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites), including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus.
- [Advanced CS](#advanced-cs) assumes the student has already taken the entirety of Core CS
and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take.
- Note that [Advanced systems](#advanced-systems) assumes the student has taken a basic physics course (e.g. AP Physics in high school).

## Intro CS

Learn a bit of Python, but focus on learning C as it's concepts can be applied to other languages and most OS are based on it, including Windows and Linux. When you look into the inter-workings of a program, you will see either C or assembly. Newer languages are basically fancy C with new implementations. However it's good to know a bunch so you aren't stuck to one language's features or limited codebase.

## Final project

This curriculum is project-focused.

After you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, put it to use.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, but this will also display your knowledge.
You can create something entirely new, or find an existing project via websites like
[CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
or
[First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/).

Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses. Here is a sample of available, guided programs.
