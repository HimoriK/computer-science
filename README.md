# Summary


Learn Computer Science with a free curated curriculum. There is [no easy way](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KICI7.png) to learn this stuff, there are [quick ways,](https://www.businessinsider.com/cfpb-states-sue-prehired-predatory-student-debt-tech-bootcamp-isa-2023-7?op=1) yes. Not [easy](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/concern-over-drop-out-rates-in-computer-science-courses-1.2491751) ways though. The quickest way, is to pick up a free book and teach yourself. That's 1 big book, or 3 specialized smaller ones. To prove my point, before you consider going on Coursera, search for a popular [programming language 
here](https://www.classcentral.com) and reviews for the courses you're interested in. Reviews imply Coursera > edX, but online curriculum is limited, as even the best universities in the world have educational issues. MIT content is also outdated. Videos are okay, but attention drifts, while practice lingers. Don't outsource your education or base it on old content. Get a proper book written in (preferably) your style and no fluff. Or pay for a good degree program.

**Sequence**. The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Intro CS*: for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them
- *Core CS*: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take
- *Advanced CS*: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests
- *Final Project*: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide

## Prerequisites

- [Core CS](#core-cs) assumes the student has already taken [high school math](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites), including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus.
- [Advanced CS](#advanced-cs) assumes the student has already taken the entirety of Core CS
and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take.
- Note that [Advanced systems](#advanced-systems) assumes the student has taken a basic physics course (e.g. AP Physics in high school).

## Intro CS

### Introduction to Programming

If you've never written a for-loop, or a string in programming, start here.

Learn a bit of Python, focus on learning C as it's concepts can be applied to other languages and most OS are based on it, including Windows and Linux. When you look into the inter-workings of a program, you will see either C or assembly. Newer languages are basically fancy C with new implementations. However it's good to know a bunch so you aren't stuck to one language's features or limited codebase.
